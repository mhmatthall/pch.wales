## About
Hey! I'm Matt and I'm empowering those with cancer in Wales through person-centred digital interventions. This site is to support and promote my PhD project as part of the EPIC CDT at Swansea University, working with Velindre University NHS Trust. It'll change as and when I need it to throughout the PhD.

The site is built with Next.js, using modular Sass for styling. CI/CD through Github Actions means it's nice and easy to update, too!

## Thanks
Thanks to all my friends and peers at Swansea University and Velindre University NHS Trust.

This work was supported by the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/S021892/1].
